Final Project for ECBS5241 - Coding for Economists 2025/26 Fall



📋 Project Overview
This repository contains my final assignment for the Coding for Economists course.
The project demonstrates data manipulation and analysis skills using both Python and Stata,
covering all 15 required learning outcomes.

To execute Student_perfomance.ipynb file, download and put two csv files into the same directory from data/raw.
For the .do file, all the needed data is in data/raw/sp500.
For representability questions, please refer to all files in the output folder and data/clean for stata .do and data/cleaned_data for the .ipynb file.
